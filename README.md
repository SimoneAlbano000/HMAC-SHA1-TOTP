# HMAC-SHA1-TOTP
 HMAC-SHA1-TOTP Auth Algorithm for Embedded Devices
 
 Implementation of the TOTP authentication algorithm written in C, suitable for Embedded application or other enviroments where a low memory impact is required.
 The current version of the algorithm is based on the HMAC-sha1 hash-based message authentication code, but future versions can be implemented using other hash functions like SHA256 and SHA512.
